For answer the main question `What happens when you type ls -l?`, we need to understand some concepts, like PATH, child, processes, etc.

We are going to talk in a depth way, so get some popcorn and come back later, because we have a lot of things for teach you.

##### Note
We are going to explain the concepts with almost all the details, so we decided to split the blog in different parts. And as you can imagine, this is part 0. 
## Lets go start!!
