# Welcome to Kayman Shell - k_shell

## Test
Kayman-shell (k_shell) it is a tiny but efficient interface line comands developed for Holberton School students.The Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult our wiki page ##include link## for a correct installations), or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

##
The utility of k_shell is that it is a command language interpreter that executes commands read from a command line string, standard input, or a specified file.

You can render LaTeX mathematical expressions using [KaTeX](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/):

The *Gamma function* satisfying $\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!\quad\forall n\in\mathbb N$ is via the Euler integral

$$
\Gamma(z) = \int_0^\infty t^{z-1}e^{-t}dt\,.
$$
