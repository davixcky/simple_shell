A signal is a **"generated interrupt"** that a process can send to another process.

## What is jekyll?

The signs are identified by an integer number. We will not detail all of them, but we will detail some of the most interesting for the programmer:

| Signal_name    |No.                            |Purpose                      |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Single backticks|`'Isn't this fun?'`            |'Isn't this fun?'            |
|Quotes          |`"Isn't this fun?"`            |"Isn't this fun?"            |
|Dashes          |`-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash`|-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash|
