<h1 style="font-size: 16px">Welcome to Kayman Shell - k_shell</h1>

<div style="margin-top: 16px"><b>Kayman-shell (k_shell)</b> is a tiny but efficient command line interface developed by Holberton School students. The Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult our Github repo for the correct setup), or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.</div>

<p style="margin-top: 16px">The k_shell is a command language interpreter that reads strings either from the command line, standard input or a given file and executes them.</p>
